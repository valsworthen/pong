## About pong  
This repo contains a very simple prototype of the game Pong made with **pygame**  
I created this in during summer 2017 in order to become familiar with the pygame package and its objects.  
  
The game is currently functional but still buggy and needs fixing that I could not implement yet.

## Running  
To play the game, just run the pong.py file and use key arrows to play !
