## About pong  
This repo contains a very simple prototype of the game Pong made with **pygame**  
I created this in during summer 2017 in order to become familiar with the pygame package and its objects.  
  
The game is currently functional but still buggy and needs fixing that I could not implement yet.

## Instructions    
**pygame is required to run the game**  
To play the game, just run the pong.py file

Player 1 : press Z/W and S to move the paddle  
Player 2 : press key arrows up and down to move the paddle  
  
You can exit by clicking the cross or pressing ESC  
  
Note that if the ball hits the top half of the paddle, then it will be moving upwards, and vice versa.  

## WIP  

Things to be fixed :  
  - collision bug with the **corners** of the paddle
